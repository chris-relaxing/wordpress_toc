# wordpress_toc
Use Python to query Wordpress MySQL database in order to create an ordered TOC of all blog articles, ordered by number of articles per category and sub-category. (Designed for wordpress.org blogs.)

This script can be seen in action on my website here:<BR>

I have also written a blog article about it here:<BR>

Here is a sample of what the TOC looks like:<br>
